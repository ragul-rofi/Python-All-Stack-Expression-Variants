# Stack Expressions Variants

This repository contains implementations of six variations of stack expressions, including conversions and evaluations. The primary focus is on the following operations:

1. Infix to Postfix Conversion
2. Infix to Prefix Conversion
3. Postfix Evaluation
4. Prefix Evaluation
5. Postfix to Infix Conversion
6. Prefix to Infix Conversion


## Features

- **Infix to Postfix Conversion**: Convert standard mathematical expressions from infix notation to postfix notation.
- **Infix to Prefix Conversion**: Convert infix expressions to prefix notation.
- **Postfix Evaluation**: Evaluate expressions written in postfix notation.
- **Prefix Evaluation**: Evaluate expressions written in prefix notation.
- **Postfix to Infix Conversion**: Convert postfix expressions back to infix notation.
- **Prefix to Infix Conversion**: Convert prefix expressions back to infix notation.
